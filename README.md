# Porting Prezi to Elm in 99 lines of code

This is the source code to a talk, I gave at [TopConf 2017](https://www.topconf.com/conference//linz-2017/talk/porting-prezi-to-elm-in-100-lines-of-code/) in Linz, Austria. It implements a simplified version of [Prezi](https://prezi.com) in [Elm](http://elmlang.org) based on SVG.
